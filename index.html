<h1>I Second That Emotion</h1>
<p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Bite my shiny metal ass.</p>
<h2>The Honking</h2> 
<p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit&hellip; that's why I'm transferring to business school! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</p> 
<ul> 
	<li>Why did you bring us here?</li> 
	<li>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</li> 
	<li>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</li> 
	<li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Lethal Inspection</h3> 
<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Why did you bring us here? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Moving along&hellip;</p> 
<h4>Brannigan, Begin Again</h4> 
<p>I'll get my kit! Is that a cooking show? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p> 
<ol> 
	<li>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</li> 
	<li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li> 
	<li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li> 
</ol> 
<h5>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h5> 
<p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</p>
